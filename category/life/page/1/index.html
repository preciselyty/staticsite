<p>Iâ&#128;&#153;m worried. And yes, I do have specific problems that I am worried about. And I can say, â&#128;&#156;oh, Iâ&#128;&#153;m really anxious, and this problem is worrying me.â&#128;&#157; The thing is though, is that those two things arenâ&#128;&#153;t completely linked. Because really, Iâ&#128;&#153;m going to continue to worry even after that problem is solved. Always, it seems like. Not 100% of the time, of course. There are times when I'm not worried. When my mind is occupied, my anxiety seems to fade a bit. But finishing one task or solving one problem doesnâ&#128;&#153;t make that feeling of anxiety go away. Not for very long. Because soon, I'll move on to a new thing to worry about. Perhaps something that hadn't even crossed my mind before. Or maybe I won't be able to think of anything specific to worry about at some point. What happens then? Well, I worry because I have nothing to worry about.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that I use the word worry. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not just constantly thinking about the next problem that could come up. Thinking ahead is great. Planning is great. But Iâ&#128;&#153;m not thinking and planning ahead. Instead, Iâ&#128;&#153;m just <em>worried. </em>Just a feeling of anxiety. Rather than thinking, I would use the word wondering. I wonder how this could go wrong. I wonder if everything is going to be okay. I wonder how everything is going to be okay, and I wonder why I feel like I need to be doing something right then.</p>



<p>And then it always is okay. You know, everything. So you might assume that I'd realize at some point that I don't need to listen to my anxiety. All of these tiny little things that I insist on stressing myself out over have never caused the end of the world. And I'm working on that. But it always feels like things just <em>arenâ&#128;&#153;t </em>going to be okay when I settle on my next thing to be worried about. So I worry some more...</p>
